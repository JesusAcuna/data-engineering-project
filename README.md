In 2003, the INS/CENAN, which is the National Institute of Health(Per√∫), implemented the Nutritional Status Information System - SIEN, based on a continuous and systematic process that records, processes, reports and analyzes information on the nutritional status of children under five years of age and pregnant women, who attend to health establishments at the first level of care of the Ministry of Health.

## Structure of the repository

The repository contains the next files and folders:

- `Kitchenware_data`: directory with 4 subdirectories: 
    - `Full_train`: Image training set
    - `Test`      : Image testing set
    
    By modifying the train size of `Full_train`, you can get a small set for a fast training 
    
    - `Train`     : Small image training set from `Full_train`
    - `Val`       : Small image testing set from `Full_train`
- `data`: directory of image dataset
- `images`: directory of images to README.md
- `static`: directory of css, js files and images for frontend 
- `templates`: directory of html files for frontend 
- `Dockerfile`: archive to containerize the project
- `app.py`: python script to make the web service for classification with `Flask`  <b>FRONTEND</b>
- `best_model.h5`: file of best chosen model 
- `best_model.tflite`: file with extension tensorflow lite of best chosen model
- `convert_to_tflite.py`: python script to convert a 'h5' file to 'tfile' file
- `model.py`: python script to enter image, do normalization and prediction <b>BACKEND</b>
- `requirements.txt`: file with dependencies and libraries
- `train.py`: python script to tune parameters and train a best model, from this script you get the directory `Kitchenware_data` and the file `best_model.h5`
- `Kitchenware_Classification.ipynb`: python notebook where the analysis and modeling is done

## 1. Description of the problem

<p align="justify">
The purpose of the nutritional status information system - SIEN, is to generate timely information on the nutritional status of the population that accesses the health establishments of the Ministry of Health, for decision-making and intervention planning at the local, regional and that contribute to improve the quality of life in Peru.
</p>

## 2. Objective

<p align="justify">

Develop a data infrastructure including data pipelines and a dashboard for users to perform advanced analytics tasks on the 

Select a dataset.
Create a pipeline for processing this dataset and putting it to a data-lake.
Create a pipeline for moving the data from the lake to a data warehouse.
Transform the data in the data warehouse: prepare it for the dashboard.
Create a dashboard.
</p>


## 3. Data description

The source of information is secondary, it corresponds to the information registered in the Clinical Histories of the Health Establishments of the Ministry of Health Peru, the registry is daily in the SIEN and HIS/MINSA. The processing and cleaning of the databases, generation of reports through tables and graphs, management reports are the responsibility of the INS/CENAN, financed by the articulated nutritional budget program (PAN).
