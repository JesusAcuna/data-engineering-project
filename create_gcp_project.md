2. Create a Google Cloud Platform account, for this you need to link your credit card. When you first create a GCP account, Google offers you 300 dollars of credit, so you can use all Google Cloud products. You can use these products for the next 3 months without any charge.

3. (Optional) After 3 months you will only have a Free Tier Google account, which offers you fewer products with restrictions , but the project can be realized with those restrictions.

<p align="justify">
   One of the products that cannot be used with the Free Tier account is Dataproc, which is a highly scalable service for running Spark and Hadoop sevices that lets you take advantage of open-source data tools for batch processing, streaming, querying and machine learning. Besides, Dataproc automation helps you create clusters quickly, manage them easily, and save money by turning off when you don't need them. 

   You can check the Free Tier usage limits in the link below:
